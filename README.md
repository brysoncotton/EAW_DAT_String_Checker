# EAW_DAT_String_Checker

This code searches for missing strings in the "Empire at War" .DAT file, which contains all the strings used in the game, making it easy to identify which
strings you may have accidently skipped.

This tool is not perfect but it should get the job done. By default there are some strings referenced in the XMLs that do not appear in the .dat file. 
I think the number is close to 330 total unreferenced tags.

If you notice any issues or have a feature request please open an issue in the tab above, and I will try to get a update out as soon as possible.
